#### Leslie Matrix Example

Model population changes using the same example we did in lecture.

```{r}
# creating vectors and matrices to represent the system of equations 
insect_leslie <- matrix(c(0, 0, 600, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.8, 0),
                        nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

insect_leslie
```

```{r}
# Creating initial conditions vector  (eggs, larvae, adult females)
insect_y0 <- c(12000, 700, 500)
```

```{r}
# year 1
insect_y1 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y0 # use dot prod operator
```

Estimate populations at each life stage at year 2 and year 3! 

```{r}
# year 2
insect_y2 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y1
# year 3 
insect_y3 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y2 
```
